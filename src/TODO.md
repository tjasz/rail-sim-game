TODO
- editing lines sucks, index matters
- mobile layout
- light-dark
- individualize recreation factor in neighborhoods
- individualize icons for neighborhoods
- make trains accelerate and decelerate
- save game state to local storage
- unassign track from line when line moves
- error where some Belltown and Bellevue riders get stuck on trains
- spread out trains when adding to line
- route and rail network calculations need to be faster so click response is better
